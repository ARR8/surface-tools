TODO:

1) AutoBacklight may be a little sensitive, come up with an algorithm that ups it by a percentage of the sensor value instead of adding 50 arbitrarily like we are, lol.

2) So, I ran the palmreject script once, never had to again? Not sure what the hell is up there.

3) Find a better way to execute these in user-context and keep app indicators (calling from .bash_profile (or .bashrc) or profile.d results in crashes/no AppIndicators in StatusBar).

4) Dynonboard works well, but has a fatal flaw, no dynamic window resizing to account for on screen apps (like in Windows), no clue if this is possible.

5) If Onbaord is closed manually, the script doesn't restart

6) GRUB has no Power Off Key/Volume +/- OS Selection/Windows Button Choose support. No clue where to begin.

7) TouchPad 3/4/5 Finger gestures aren't simple to map, need to make a script to auto-map them

8) Update Python2 Scripts to Python3 (not necessary, jsut for simplicities sake)

9) Make all of these scripts work on LockScreen (mainly Dynonboard, but others would be nice)

10) Force WebCam HAL to use second highest resolution, as Windows does, because the Camera Sensor just can't handle it (jerky, choppy video, etc.)

11) Make a GCC compliant make file to pull in the kernel repo and build upon 'make', then 'make install' installs the kernel package, and places the scripts and sets them to auto-start on system start

12) Port all of this to Android-x86 (see device tree 'android_device_microsoft_sp3' for more info on that)

13) Optional UEFI Shim to skip GRUB if users don't have Windows/Other Bootable medium installed

14) Make Pen Rear Button work

15) Make Pen Right Click Button work
